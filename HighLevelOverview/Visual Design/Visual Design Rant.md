Overall visual design thoughts and considerations

Our visual design should allow ease of scaling of objects on different zoom levels, allow destruction/cretion of environment by user, should allow for clear destinction and uniqness of characters/npcs. And obviously should be pleasant for eyes. Overall feel direction is to have more high fantasy vibrant pixel art style.

Biggest question right now is what camera setup and angle to use. isometric side view looks very promising because of good possibility to showcase our characters and their details, wich aligns well with the philosophy of the project.
