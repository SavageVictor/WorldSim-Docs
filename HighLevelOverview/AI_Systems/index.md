# AI Systems

The AI systems define how NPCs think, feel, and interact with each other and the world, creating emergent narratives through personality-driven behavior, dynamic relationships, and complex social dynamics.

---

## Overview

### Core Systems (MVP)

Foundation systems ready for implementation:

- **Executive Summary** - Philosophy, key numbers, implementation priorities
- **NPC Tiering** - Efficient simulation across 10,000 NPCs
- **Personality System** - 7 traits driving every decision
- **Relationships** - Multi-dimensional bonds between NPCs
- **Factions** - Group dynamics and politics
- **Occupations** - Dynamic career emergence
- **Needs & Goals** - Modified Maslow hierarchy
- **Interactions** - How NPCs affect each other
- **Memory & Learning** - Past informing future
- **Reputation & Gossip** - Social information spread
- **Conflict Resolution** - When goals collide
- **Civilization Dynamics** - Macro-level emergence

### Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Advanced features adding depth and polish:

- **Promotion System** - NPCs rising from masses to legends
- **Future Systems** - Religion, environment, combat, player interaction
- **Advanced Features** - Memory evolution, dynasties, ideologies

## Key Principles

### Stories Emerge from Systems, Not Scripts

All narratives emerge from system interactions. No pre-written stories.

### Personality Drives Behavior

Every decision filtered through 7 personality traits creating consistent but unpredictable NPCs.

### Scale Through Tiering

Balance depth (notable NPCs) with performance (10,000 total).

### Cascading Effects

Individual decisions create civilization-level changes.

## Key Numbers

### Population Distribution
- **Tier 1 (Masses)**: 9,000 NPCs (90%)
- **Tier 2 (Notable)**: 900 NPCs (9%)
