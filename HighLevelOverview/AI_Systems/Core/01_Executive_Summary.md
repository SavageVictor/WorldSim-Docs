## **1.1 Core Philosophy**

**Stories emerge from systems, not scripts.**

In this civilization simulation, thousands of NPCs create dynamic narratives through:

* **Deep relationships** that evolve over time  
* **Personalities** that shape every decision  
* **Emergent occupations** that respond to world conditions  
* **Factional dynamics** that drive civilizations  
* **Memories** that inform future actions

The simulation creates conditions. The NPCs write the story.

**Key Principles:**

1. **No pre-scripted stories** - All narratives emerge from system interactions  
2. **Personality drives behavior** - Every decision filtered through personality traits  
3. **Scale through tiering** - Balance depth (notable NPCs) with performance (masses)  
4. **Cascading effects** - Individual decisions create civilization-level changes  
5. **Player as conductor** - Set conditions, observe emergence, intervene strategically

## **1.2 Key Numbers & Ratios**

### **Population Distribution**

Total NPCs per Civilization: ~10,000

```
Tier 1 (Masses):           9,000 NPCs (90%)
  - 3-trait + 7-trait personality
  - Faction relationships only (no individual tracking)
  - Class-based goals

Tier 2 (Notable):            900 NPCs (9%)
  - Full 7-trait personality
  - Track up to 20 individual relationships
  - Dynamic personal goals

Tier 3 (Major Players):      100 NPCs (1%)
  - Full 7-trait personality
  - Track up to 50-100 individual relationships
  - Multiple concurrent goals (personal + factional + dynastic)
```

### **Healthy Civilization Occupation Ratios**

```
Farmers:     60-70%  (Food security)
Craftsmen:   10-15%  (Goods production)
Soldiers:     5-10%  (Defense without over-militarization)
Merchants:    5-10%  (Trade flowing)
Bandits:      <2%    (Crime controlled)
Nobles:       <1%    (Governance)
Others:       3-8%   (Servants, laborers, specialized roles)
```

### **Faction Distribution per Civilization**

```
Major Factions:    3-5   (Noble, Merchant, Clergy, Military, Regional)
Minor Factions:   10-20  (Specific houses, guilds, cults, movements)

Each NPC belongs to: 1-3 factions
```

### **Relationship Tracking Limits**

```
Tier 1: No individual relationships (only faction relationships)
Tier 2: Max 20 tracked relationships
Tier 3: Max 50-100 tracked relationships
```

### **Memory Storage Limits**

```
Tier 1: Last 5 major civilization events
Tier 2: Last 20 events + 10 memories per relationship
Tier 3: Last 50 events + 10 memories per relationship
```

### **Time & Aging**

```
Aging Speed: Approximate to Rimworld pace
- 1 year = ~12-60 real-time minutes (adjustable)
- NPCs age, have children, die
- Generational shifts occur (30-year cycles)
```

## **1.3 Implementation Priorities**

### **CORE SYSTEMS (MVP - Must Have)**

**Phase 1: Foundation**
* NPC Tiering System (all 3 tiers)  
* Personality System (3-trait + 7-trait for all NPCs)  
* Faction System (all NPCs)  
* Basic Occupation System (emergence conditions)  
* Need & Goal System (Maslow hierarchy)  
* Civilization-Level Dynamics (occupation ratios, faction balance)

**Phase 2: Depth**
* Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Tier 2/3)  
* Interaction System (NPCs talk and affect each other)  
* Memory & Learning (past informs future)  
* Conflict Resolution (how goals clash)

**Phase 3: Social**
* Reputation & Gossip (information spreads socially)  
* Basic Promotion System (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3)

**Why Core:** These systems create the basic simulation loop. NPCs have personality, belong to factions, choose occupations based on needs, and affect civilization health.
