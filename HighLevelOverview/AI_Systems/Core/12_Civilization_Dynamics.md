## **2.11 Civilization-Level Dynamics**

### **Purpose**

Individual NPC decisions aggregate into civilization-level patterns. Healthy civilizations maintain balance; unhealthy ones spiral into dysfunction.

---

### **2.11.1 Occupation Ratios & Health**

**Healthy Civilization Balance:**

| Occupation | Healthy % | Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Farmers | 60-70% | Food production, stability |
| Craftsmen | 10-15% | Goods production, infrastructure |
| Soldiers | 5-10% | Defense without over-militarization |
| Merchants | 5-10% | Trade, wealth circulation |
| Bandits | <2% | Crime controlled, law functional |
| Nobles | <1% | Governance, leadership |
| Others | 3-8% | Servants, laborers, specialized roles |

**Warning Signs:**

| Imbalance | Symptom | Consequences |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Farmers <50% | Food shortage | Famine, unrest, death spiral |
| Soldiers >20% | Over-militarization | Economic drain, aggressive policy |
| Bandits >5% | Lawlessness | Trade collapse, state failure |
| Craftsmen <5% | No goods | Infrastructure decay, poverty |

See **Appendix F.2: Civilization Death Spirals** for detailed examples including over-militarization and wise governance cycles.

### **2.11.2 Factional Power Balance**

**Power Distribution Effects:**

**One Faction Dominates (>70% influence):**
- Other factions resentful  
- Revolutionary sentiment builds  
- Tyranny OR Benevolent dictatorship (personality dependent)

**Balanced Power (No faction >40%):**
- Cooperation necessary  
- Compromise governance  
- Stability through checks and balances

**Chaotic Fragmentation (Many factions <20%):**
- Constant infighting  
- Weak central authority  
- Vulnerable to external threats

See **Appendix F.3: Faction Power Struggle Examples** for Noble-Merchant conflict scenarios.

### **2.11.3 Cultural/Religious Movements**

**How Movements Start:**

```
1. CRISIS creates need
2. CHARISMATIC FIGURE emerges (Tier 3 NPC)
3. MESSAGE resonates with specific personalities
4. FACTION SPLITS or NEW FACTION forms
5. CONFLICT RESOLUTION (any method from Section 2.10)
6. OUTCOME shapes civilization
```

**Pattern:**
- Traditional NPCs resist change  
- Progressive NPCs embrace new ideas  
- Outcome depends on faction power and conflict resolution

See **Appendix F.4: Political Reform Movement Example** for detailed year-by-year progression.

### **2.11.4 Population Dynamics**

**Birth/Death Affects Composition:**

**Peace + Prosperity:**
- High birth rate → Young population  
- More Ambitious personalities  
- Pressure for expansion/change

**War + Famine:**
- High death rate → Aging population  
- More Cautious personalities  
- Conservative, risk-averse culture

**Generational Shifts (30-year cycles):**

```
GENERATION 1: FOUNDERS
- Values: Brave, Ambitious, Traditional
- Memories: Hardship, struggle

GENERATION 2: INHERITORS
- Values: Content, Social, Progressive
- Forgets founding lessons

GENERATION 3: CRISIS GENERATION
- Values: Return to Brave, Ambitious
- Relearn lessons of Generation 1
```

**Population Pressure:**
- Overpopulation → Competition, unrest, expansion, war
- Underpopulation → Labor shortage, vulnerable, cultural stagnation
