# Economic Systems

The economic systems create realistic trade, production, and resource flow dynamics through observable, physical, and emergent mechanics.

---

## Overview

### Core Systems (MVP)

Foundation systems ready for implementation:

- **Core Philosophy** - Observable, physical, emergent design principles
- **Resource Systems** - Categories, inventory, and flow visualization
- **Production Systems** - Extraction, crafting, professional requirements
- **Trade & Commerce** - Acquaintance networks, trade discovery, reliability
- **Market Systems** - Physical locations, buyer/seller behavior
- **Currency & Value** - Simple currency, baseline pricing
- **System Integration** - AI systems integration points
- **Implementation Plan** - Phases, metrics, performance targets

### Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Advanced features adding depth and polish:

- **Tier 1** - Market-responsive production, dynamic pricing, negotiation, spoilage
- **Tier 2** - Barter, gossip accuracy, trade reputation, personality consumption
- **Tier 3** - Emergent currency, employment, investment, trade routes, policies

## Key Principles

### Observable

Every resource has physical presence. Players can see NPCs extract, carry, store, and trade.

### Physical

Resources exist as actual items in inventories. NPCs must physically travel and carry goods. Markets are physical locations.

### Emergent

Economy arises from individual NPC production, consumption, and trade decisions. No centralized market systems.

## Design Principles

### Three Pillars

1. **Observable**: Players can trace resource lifecycles from extraction to consumption
2. **Physical**: Resources are actual items that must be carried and stored
3. **Emergent**: Market dynamics arise from NPC decisions, not scripts

### Core Integration

Economic systems integrate directly with:
- **Need & Goal System** - NPCs trade to satisfy needs
- **Occupation System** - Professional requirements drive demand
- **Personality System** - Personalities shape trade behavior
- **Relationship System** - Trust affects trade willingness

## Key Numbers

### Professional Requirements
- **Farmers**: Need tools (productivity 0% without)
- **Craftsmen**: Need materials to craft
- **Soldiers**: Need weapons (combat effectiveness 30% without)
- **Merchants**: Need starting inventory to trade

### Market Scale
- **Village Market**: 10-20 stalls, daily, local (5-mile radius)
- **Town Market**: 50-100 stalls, daily + weekly fair, regional (20-mile radius)
- **City Market**: 100-200+ stalls, daily + monthly fair, civilization-wide

### Healthy Ratios
- **Farmers**: 60-70% (food security)
- **Craftsmen**: 10-15% (goods production)
- **Merchants**: 5-10% (trade flowing)
