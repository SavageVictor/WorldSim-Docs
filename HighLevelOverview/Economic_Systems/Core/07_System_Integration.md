# **PART 7: SYSTEM INTEGRATION**

## **7.1 Integration with Need & Goal System**

**Reference: AI Systems - Core, Section 2.6**

Economic behavior is driven by the Need Hierarchy:

### **TIER 1: SURVIVAL**
- **Economic Behavior:** MUST acquire food immediately, pay any affordable price, steal if cannot afford
- **Trade Priority:** Food above all else
- **Price Sensitivity:** ZERO (will pay anything available)

### **TIER 2: SECURITY**
- **Economic Behavior:** Seek steady profession, buy professional requirements, save surplus
- **Trade Priority:** Professional needs (tools, materials)
- **Price Sensitivity:** MODERATE (will pay premium for critical items)

### **TIER 3: BELONGING**
- **Economic Behavior:** Trade at loss to build relationships, give gifts to friends
- **Trade Priority:** Social goods (gifts, festival items)
- **Price Sensitivity:** HIGH (willing to overpay for relationship building)

### **TIER 4: ESTEEM**
- **Economic Behavior:** Accumulate wealth, buy luxury goods (display wealth), invest in business
- **Trade Priority:** Wealth accumulation, luxury display
- **Price Sensitivity:** LOW for luxuries (status symbols worth premium)

### **TIER 5: SELF-ACTUALIZATION**
- **Economic Behavior:** Fund projects, mentor others, create lasting change
- **Trade Priority:** Ideological goals over profit
- **Price Sensitivity:** ZERO (will spend everything on purpose)

See **Appendix E.1: Need-Driven Trade Decisions** for detailed scenario examples.

## **7.2 Integration with Occupation System**

**Reference: AI Systems - Core, Section 2.5**

**Professional Requirements Drive Trade:**
- Farmers need tools → Must buy from craftsmen
- Craftsmen need materials → Must buy from miners/woodcutters
- Soldiers need weapons → Must buy from craftsmen
- **Result:** Occupational interdependence creates natural trade networks

**Occupation Emergence from Economic Conditions:**
- High demand for wheat → Wheat price rises → Farming more profitable → Ambitious NPCs switch to farmer
- See AI Doc 2.5.3: Occupation Emergence Conditions

**Occupation Satisfaction Affected by Economics:**
- Materials abundant → Craftsman can craft → Steady income → Satisfaction +30
- Materials scarce → Cannot craft → No income → Satisfaction -40 → May switch profession

See **Appendix E.2: Professional Requirements Economic Chain** for tool production example.

## **7.3 Integration with Personality System**

**Reference: AI Systems - Core, Section 2.2**

Personality shapes economic behavior:

### **AMBITIOUS**
- **Trade:** Seeks high-value trades, travels far, becomes merchant easily
- **Occupation:** Prefers profitable professions, switches for higher income
- **Market:** Stays longer, sets higher prices

### **CAUTIOUS**
- **Trade:** Prefers local reliable suppliers, accepts first reasonable offer
- **Occupation:** Prefers stable professions, rarely switches
- **Market:** Leaves if no buyers quickly, lowers price to sell fast

### **RATIONAL**
- **Trade:** Calculates fair value, seeks optimal trades, long-term plans
- **Occupation:** Chooses profession based on economic analysis
- **Market:** Observes supply/demand, adjusts prices logically

### **SOCIAL**
- **Trade:** Spreads information rapidly, builds large network, trades to strengthen relationships
- **Market:** Spends time chatting, attracts customers through friendliness

### **HONEST**
- **Trade:** Sets fair prices, keeps promises, builds trustworthiness
- **Market:** Transparent about stock, builds repeat customer base

### **DECEITFUL**
- **Trade:** May set deceptive prices, breaks promises if profitable
- **Market:** Short-term profit over trust, loses customers when caught

See **Appendix E.3: Personality-Driven Economic Behavior** for comparison scenarios.

## **7.4 Emergent Economic Patterns**

**What Naturally Emerges from These Systems:**

### **PATTERN 1: Local Specialization**
- Village A (good farmland) → Many farmers → Wheat abundant
- Village B (near forest/mountains) → Many extractors → Wood/ore abundant
- **Result:** Trade interdependence, merchants connect them, regional economy

### **PATTERN 2: Merchant Class Emergence**
- Ambitious + Rational NPCs observe price differences
- Buy low, travel, sell high
- Become known as traders
- Others imitate → More merchants → Market efficiency increases

### **PATTERN 3: Boom-Bust Cycles**
- Tool prices high → NPCs switch to craftsman → Tool supply increases → Prices drop
- Eventually finds equilibrium through oscillation

### **PATTERN 4: Trade Hub Emergence**
- Central city with many NPCs → Diverse goods → Information spreads
- Reputation: "City has everything" → More merchants attracted
- Positive feedback loop → Trade capital

### **PATTERN 5: Economic Stratification**
- After 20 years: Rich (successful merchants/landowners), Middle Class (working professions), Poor (laborers), Destitute (bandits/beggars)

### **PATTERN 6: Economic Crises**
- Famine → Food prices skyrocket → Poor cannot afford → Starvation → Banditry
- Recovery paths: Faction reserves, imports, emergency farming, population decline

See **Appendix D: Economic Pattern Examples** for detailed scenarios of each pattern.
